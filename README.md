### Transforming 2.3M Administrative Records into Prescriptive ML Insights

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end data science pipeline analyzing over **2.3 million Aadhaar administrative records**. The project identifies regional service gaps and infrastructure maturity using unsupervised machine learning.

## 🛠️ Key Technical Features
- **Data Architecture**: Multi-stream integration of Enrolment, Demographic, and Biometric datasets using a 4-key composite join.
- **Geographic Standardization**: Automated pipeline to unify fragmented state/district labels (e.g., merging "ODISHA" and "Orissa").
- **Prescriptive Analytics**: Engineered proprietary indices including **MBU Compliance**, **Digital Mobility**, and **Market Saturation**.
- **Machine Learning**: Unsupervised **K-Means Clustering** using **MaxAbsScaler** to preserve data sparsity while segmenting 700+ districts.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **The Policy Gap**: Identified critical risk zones with 0.0 MBU compliance (e.g., Domjur, Visakhapatnam).
- **Market Maturity**: Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh identified as "Maintenance Focused" hubs.
- **Economic Proxy**: "Digital Mobility" hubs found in North Delhi and Mewat, indicating high migrant worker demand.
